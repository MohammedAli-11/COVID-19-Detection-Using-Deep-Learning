# COVID-19 Detection Using Deep Learning 
  We will be building a project to detect COVID-19 from Chest X-Rays by Using Convolution Neural Network.  
- Dataset Preparation 
- Understanding the Dataset 
- Building a CNN 
- Model Training


First Update

For building a COVID-19 Detection system what we must do iniially is we have to prepare our own dataset. For this purpose we took two different dataset from kaggle and github.
